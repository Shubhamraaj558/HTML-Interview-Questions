            Example:-
            <form action="/submit" method="get">
            <label for="name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
            <label for="email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </form>

            When the form is submitted, the data is sent as part of the URL, 
            like this: -/submit?name=JohnDoe&email=johndoe@example.com
